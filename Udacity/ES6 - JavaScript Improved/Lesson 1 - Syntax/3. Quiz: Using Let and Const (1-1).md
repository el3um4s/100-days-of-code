## 3. Quiz: Using Let and Const (1-1)

#### Directions
Replace the variable declarations using `let` or `const`.

```javascript
var CHARACTER_LIMIT = 255;
var posts = [
	"#DeepLearning transforms everything from self-driving cars to language translations. AND it's our new Nanodegree!",
	"Within your first week of the VR Developer Nanodegree Program, you'll make your own virtual reality app",
	"I just finished @udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Check it out!"
];

// prints posts to the console
function displayPosts() {
	for (var i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) {
		console.log(posts[i].slice(0, CHARACTER_LIMIT));
	}
}

displayPosts();
```

#### My Solution

```javascript
const CHARACTER_LIMIT = 255;
const posts = [
	"#DeepLearning transforms everything from self-driving cars to language translations. AND it's our new Nanodegree!",
	"Within your first week of the VR Developer Nanodegree Program, you'll make your own virtual reality app",
	"I just finished @udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Check it out!"
];

// prints posts to the console
function displayPosts() {
	for (let i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) {
		console.log(posts[i].slice(0, CHARACTER_LIMIT));
	}
}

displayPosts();
```
