## 3. Symbols

A **symbol** is a unique and immutable data type that is often used to identify object properties.  

To create a symbol, you write `Symbol()` with an optional string as its **description**.

```javascript
const sym1 = Symbol('apple');
```
This will create a unique symbol and store it in `sym1`. The description `"apple"` is just a way to describe the symbol, but it can’t be used to access the symbol itself.

```javascript
const bowl = {
  [Symbol('apple')]: { color: 'red', weight: 136.078 },
  [Symbol('banana')]: { color: 'yellow', weight: 183.15 },
  [Symbol('orange')]: { color: 'orange', weight: 170.097 },
  [Symbol('banana')]: { color: 'yellow', weight: 176.845 }
};

console.log(bowl);
```
> **Return**
```javascript
Object {Symbol(apple): Object,
        Symbol(banana): Object,
        Symbol(orange): Object,
        Symbol(banana): Object
      }
```

By changing the bowl’s properties to use symbols, each property is a unique Symbol and the first banana doesn’t get overwritten by the second banana.
