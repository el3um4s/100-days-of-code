## 7. "this" and Regular Functions

To get a handle on how `this` works differently with arrow functions, let's do a quick recap of how `this` works in a standard function. If you have a solid grasp of how `this` works already, feel free to jump over this section.

The value of the this keyword is based completely on how its function (or method) is called. this could be any of the following:

#### 1. A new object
If the function is called with `new`:
```javascript
const mySundae = new Sundae('Chocolate', ['Sprinkles', 'Hot Fudge']);
```
In the code above, the value of `this` inside the `Sundae` constructor function is a new object because it was called with `new`.

#### 2. A specified object
If the function is invoked with `call/apply`:
```javascript
const result = obj1.printName.call(obj2);
```
In the code above, the value of `this` inside `printName()` will refer to `obj2` since the first parameter of `call()` is to explicitly set what `this` refers to.

#### 3. A context object
If the function is a method of an object:
```javascript
data.teleport();
```
In the code above, the value of `this` inside `teleport()` will refer to `data`.

#### 4. The global object or undefined
If the function is called with no context:
```javascript
teleport();
```
In the code above, the value of `this` inside `teleport()` is either the global object or, if in strict mode, it's `undefined`.

**TIP**: `this` in JavaScript is a complicated topic. We just did a quick overview, but for an in-depth look at how `this` is determined, check out [this All Makes Sense Now!](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md) from Kyle Simpson's book series [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md).
