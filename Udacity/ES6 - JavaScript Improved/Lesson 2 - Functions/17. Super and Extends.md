## 17. Super and Extends
#### Subclasses with ES6

Now that we've looked at creating classes in JavaScript. Let's use the new `super` and `keywords` to extend a class.
```javascript
class Tree {
  constructor(size = '10', leaves = {spring: 'green', summer: 'green', fall: 'orange', winter: null}) {
    this.size = size;
    this.leaves = leaves;
    this.leafColor = null;
  }

  changeSeason(season) {
    this.leafColor = this.leaves[season];
    if (season === 'spring') {
      this.size += 1;
    }
  }
}

class Maple extends Tree {
  constructor(syrupQty = 15, size, leaves) {
    super(size, leaves);
    this.syrupQty = syrupQty;
  }

  changeSeason(season) {
    super.changeSeason(season);
    if (season === 'spring') {
      this.syrupQty += 1;
    }
  }

  gatherSyrup() {
    this.syrupQty -= 3;
  }
}

const myMaple = new Maple(15, 5);
myMaple.changeSeason('fall');
myMaple.gatherSyrup();
myMaple.changeSeason('spring');
```
Both `Tree` and `Maple` are JavaScript classes. The Maple class is a "subclass" of `Tree` and uses the `extends` keyword to set itself as a "subclass". To get from the "subclass" to the parent class, the `super` keyword is used. Did you notice that `super` was used in two different ways? In `Maple`'s constructor method, `super` is used as a function. In `Maple`'s `changeSeason()` method, super is used as an object!
